SwaggerLoad
===========

**SwaggerLoad** is a smoke test & load test tool.

It's using an Open API (Swagger) description for a service to
automatically check every endpoint described.

If needed, you can write your own tests and assertions, by
linking a function to a Swagger operation id.

SwaggerLoad can be used as a load tester using Loads.
