BasicLoad
=========

**BasicLoad** leverages Boom! to run load tests on a server.

It's using an Open API (Swagger) description of the server endpoints
and sends its activity via statsd.

BasicLoad comes with a Docker image that can be used with Loads
to automatically run a distributed load tests on a running server
by grabbing a published JSON file on that server.
